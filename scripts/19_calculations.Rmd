Basic calculations of diet vs. allocation vs. marine/terrestrial
```{r}

summarised_demand <- 
  all_demand |> 
  filter(!demand_from %in% c("Total")) |> 
  group_by(diet, demand_from) |> 
  summarise(mean_demand = mean(demand, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd_demand = sd(demand, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_demand = min(demand, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_demand = max(demand, na.rm =TRUE)) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
  arrange(diet, -mean_demand)



#What is overall demand by diet (accounting for allocation)

#minimum
summarised_demand |> 
  group_by(diet, allocation) |> 
  summarise(minimum = sum(min_demand))
  
#max
summarised_demand |> 
  group_by(diet, allocation) |> 
  summarise(maximum = sum(max_demand))


#mean
summarised_demand |> 
  group_by(diet, allocation) |> 
  summarise(average = sum(mean_demand))


#average mass
mean_plant_mass <- 
  summarised_demand |> 
  group_by(diet, allocation) |> 
  summarise(average = sum(mean_demand)) |> 
  filter(diet == "plant_diet" & allocation == "Mass allocation") |> ungroup() |> 
  pull(average)
  

mean_fish_mass <- 
  summarised_demand |> 
  group_by(diet, allocation) |> 
  summarise(average = sum(mean_demand)) |> 
  filter(diet == "marine_diet" & allocation == "Mass allocation") |> ungroup() |> 
  pull(average)

mean_plant_mass/mean_fish_mass # ratio of raw material demand between fish- and plant-dominant feeds



all_demand |> filter(demand_from!= "Total") |>  mutate(realm = if_else(demand_from %in% c("Fishmeal", "Fish oil"), true = "marine", false = "terrestrial")) |> 
  group_by(realm, diet, demand_from, allocation) |>  summarise(mean_ = mean(demand)) |> ungroup() |>  group_by(realm, diet, allocation) |> summarise(sum_mean = sum(mean_)) |> arrange(diet, allocation, realm)
```

Example of differences in raw material and total pressure for same ingredient within different diet
```{r}

brazil_sbm <- rast(here("data/spatial/marine_diet/int/soybean meal_ghg_gp_mass_allocation_BRA.tif"))

us_sbm <- rast(here("data/spatial/marine_diet/int/soybean meal_ghg_gp_mass_allocation_USA.tif"))


(brazil_sbm |> values() |> sum(na.rm=TRUE)/1000) /(us_sbm |> values() |> sum(na.rm=TRUE)/1000)

```
