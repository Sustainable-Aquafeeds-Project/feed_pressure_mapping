This file is used to rescale all rasters' values for each pressure so that values among feeds may be compared.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(terra)
library(here)

```


## Disturbance

Bring in  forage fish and crop layers for disturbance for both diets

```{r}

marine_diet_disturbance <- list.files(here("data/spatial/marine_diet/int"), pattern = "disturbance_km2", full.names = TRUE)

plant_diet_disturbance <- list.files(here("data/spatial/plant_diet/int"), pattern = "disturbance_km2", full.names = TRUE)

all_disturbance <- c(marine_diet_disturbance, plant_diet_disturbance)
