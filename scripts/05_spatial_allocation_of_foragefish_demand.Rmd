To get the embodied_fish_by_cell.csv file imported below, you need to run the corresponding code in the fisheries section of 02_calculate_global_feed_demand.Rmd. 

```{r}
#this is the embodied demand from each 'area' per diet

forage_demand_totals <- readRDS(here("data/tidy_data/demand/embodied_fish_demand_by_source_diet.rds"))

forage_demand_bycell <- fread(here("data/tidy_data/demand/embodied_fish_per_cell.csv"))


```
